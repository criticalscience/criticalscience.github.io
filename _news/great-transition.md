The session of May 30th coincides with the conference [The Great Transition](https://thegreattransition.net/), an international conference focused this year on "reviving post-capitalist solidarities". Exceptionally, we invite you to attend this conference instead!

In particular, the usual time of the reading group session coincides with a workshop at The Great Transition co-organised by some attendees and organisers of the reading group which focuses on a very relevant topic: Exploring roles for technology in radical theories of change.
