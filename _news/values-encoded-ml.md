In the second session of the reading group, we will discuss [The Values Encoded in Machine Learning Research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533083).

On Friday May 16th, we will discuss this 2022 paper by Birhane et al. published at FAccT, which aimed at surfacing and discussing the values encoded in machine learning research by manually analysing 100 highly cited papers in terms of the values highlighted in the text as well as their social and political significance. Furthermore, the paper also analyses the affiliations and funding of the authors of the papers.

We believe this is an excellent way to continue our initial broad perspective on critical science, still with a clear focus on our most familiar domain, machine learning.
