The Mila reading group Against Military AI will expand its range of topics and become the Critical Science reading group.

Against Military AI started in March 2024 as the first reading group at Mila covering the important but difficult topic of the implication of AI technology in warfare. In spite of facing more challenges than other reading groups, many members of the Mila community attended and actively engaged in the biweekly sessions. Related to this workshop, in December 2024 we organised the workshop [Harms and Risks of AI in the Military](https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/), which hosted talks and panels with renowned, international speakers. The success of the reading group and the workshop, as well as other reading groups such as FATES, demonstrate the strong interest by a large part of the Mila community in better understanding the social implications of our work, artificial intelligence, technology and science at large.

As a natural development, we have planned to expand the range of topics covered by the reading group and incorporate an interdisciplinary perspective to critically analyse the deep and far-reaching interactions between science, technology and society, with a special focus on artificial intelligence. To better reflect the expanded lens of the reading group, we are renaming it as _Critical Science_.
