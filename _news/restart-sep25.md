The Critical Science Reading Group at Mila is coming back to life after the summer break!

We are back with renewed energy, excited to discuss a ton of important topics through a critical lens. The reading group took a summer break, but the AI-enabled genocide in Gaza did not, and it has only got worse with the intensified blockade of humanitarian aid by Israel and their continued assassination of Palestinians in Gaza. For these reasons and because there can hardly be a more urgent topic to discuss, we will start the semester with a session about the genocide in Gaza.

In particular, we will discuss the recent report by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, [_From economy of occupation to economy of genocide_](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/a-hrc-59-23-from-economy-of-occupation-to-economy-of-genocide-report-special-rapporteur-francesca-albanese-palestine-2025/). This report investigates how the corporate machinery in general, and tech companies in particular (including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon), benefit from the current illegal occupation of Palestine. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent report of Palestinian Youth Movement, [_Exposing Canadian military exports to Israel_](https://armsembargonow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Exposing-Canadian-Military-Exports-to-Israel_07292025_compressed-.pdf), contradicting repeated claims that Canada has stopped sending weapons to Israel.
