The first session of the Critical Science reading group will cover the paper Decolonial AI.

On Friday May 2nd, we host the first session of the new Critical Science reading group at Mila, which evolves from the previous Against Military AI reading group. We will first introduce this new initiative briefly and then dedicate the rest of the session to discuss the first selected paper: [Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04068), by Shakir Mohamed, Marie-Therese Png and William Isaac.

We have thought this paper offers an interesting, broad and critical perspective of artificial intelligence that is very suitable to set the scence for the Critical Science reading group. It touches upon many of the topics we aim to cover, with a focus on AI but with an interdisciplinary approach that matches our intended position too.
